        <h3>Hey There!</h3>
        <pre>
My name is Oral Mazuz, I was born in 1998.
and grew up in the settlement "Peduel" vlocated in the Samaria mountains.
As you already know I am an Industrial Engineering and Management student.
This term I study front-end development and this website is part of my academic work.

      From a young age I fell in love with the game of basketball, I was finally the best at something.
      Hours of playing after school against whoever wanted to.
      Finally, these hours led me to be the best in the class in basketball.
      Later I grew up and graduated high school, joined the army and returned to basketball, this time as a coach.
      with the aim of empowering the children and developing unique character traits in them, for example determination,
      adherence to a goal, fairness, friendship, mutual respect and more.

      While coaching basketball, I began to combine studies in industrial engineering and management.
      And today I am already in the process of looking for a job in the field of industry and management, and hope to make a foothold in the field soon.
      
      Shortly before the military service, I married the stunning Tahar, who gave birth to 2 daughters, Far and Sof.
      And a little to the future.. I see myself in 5 years from today, continuing to work hard to bring myself to a place of satisfaction and doing.
      I continue to raise my children and nurture my relationship with my wife, for many more good years together.
      
      And the picture you ask?
      Following the events of 7.10, I enlisted in the reserves, I fought in Gaza to protect the State of Israel, which I love so much.
